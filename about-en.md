# About me

I’m Carlos Pérez, a network engineer and IT professional passionate about routing, critical network operations and the Internet ecosystem.

I currently work on the technical operation of an **Internet Exchange Point (IXP)**, where I help design, deploy and operate peering infrastructure. My daily work combines BGP, RPKI, automation, monitoring and coordination with network operators and CDNs.

## What I do today

In my current role I focus on:

- **Routing and BGP**
  - Design and operation of peering sessions.
  - Routing policies, communities and best practices (RFCs/BCPs).
  - Route optimization for local traffic and content delivery.

- **IXPs and infrastructure operations**
  - Switching and routing architectures for Internet Exchange Points.
  - Link management, capacity planning and platform growth.
  - Coordination with ISPs, carriers and content networks.

- **Routing security: RPKI and IRR**
  - Route validation and RPKI validator deployment.
  - Guiding members through ROA creation and maintenance.
  - Improving data quality and responsible use of IRR databases.

- **CDN & peering**
  - Onboarding and operating caches from major CDNs (Google, Cloudflare, Apple, Akamai, etc.).
  - Tracking performance, traffic metrics and local value for the community.

- **Automation and monitoring**
  - Using tools like LibreNMS, Zabbix, pmacct, Grafana and others.
  - Small scripts and tooling for reports, alerts and traffic visibility.

- **Training and community**
  - Teaching and mentoring in networking topics (CCNA/CCNP-style content).
  - Participating in technical community spaces (NOGs, IXPs, RIRs).

## Interests

Some of the areas I enjoy working on:

- Design and operation of **BGP** at provider and IXP level.  
- **Routing security** (RPKI, IRR, MANRS).  
- Efficient **CDN and peering** architectures.  
- Telemetry, **traffic monitoring** and network data analysis.  
- Sharing knowledge through articles, labs and technical talks.

## Training and community
  - I teach and mentor networking students as a **Cisco Networking Academy Instructor**, delivering CCNA/CCNP-style courses and helping new engineers develop solid foundations in networking and infrastructure operations.
  - I participate in technical community spaces (NOGs, IXPs, RIRs).
